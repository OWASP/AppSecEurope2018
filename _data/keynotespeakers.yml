    Dr.-Ing. Mario Heiderich, handsome heart-breaker, bon-vivant and (as he loves to call himself) "security researcher" is from Berlin, likes everything between lesser- and greater-than, leads the small yet exquisite pen-test company called Cure53 and pesters peaceful attendees on various 5th tier conferences with his hastily assembled powerpoint-slides. Mario loves pretty much everything about London - the amazing weather, the great food, the fresh air, long walks at the beach... he literally cannot wait to be here again.
