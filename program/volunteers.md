OWASP is a volunteer organization. Volunteering carries many benefits including meeting great people, learning new skills, and above all â€“ fun! Although volunteers will be expected to work through most of the conference, free time can be spent enjoying the rest of the event!

Volunteers need to sign up for a minimum of 8 hours of work to receive a complimentary conference participation badge. 

There will be a form to complete if you wish to volunteer.  Please check back in the coming days to complete the volunteer form.
