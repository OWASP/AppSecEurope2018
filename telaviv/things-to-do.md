## 1. BEACHES
Tel Aviv’s west side is a 13-kilometer (eight-mile) stretch of sandy beaches, prompting National Geographic magazine to call Tel Aviv “Miami Beach on the Med.”

## 2. SIGHTSEEING

### Tel Aviv-Jaffa Promenade

The Tel Aviv-Jaffa Promenade is a bustling walkway that connects Old Jaffa in the south to the northern neighborhoods of the city. Come here for gorgeous sunsets, people-watching, yummy food at one of the cafés or restaurants along the promenade, or to hear some of the best classical music buskers you’re likely to come across.

### Hayarkon Park
Also called as the “Central Park of Tel Aviv”, attracts some 16 million visitors every year. The urban park’s 3.8 square kilometers boast walking paths, bike paths, dozens of children play areas, botanical gardens, extensive lawns, sports facilities, two mini zoos and artificial lakes.

### Old Jaffa
No visit to Tel Aviv is complete without a hop over to Old Jaffa. It is one of the world’s oldest cities and home to the oldest seaport in the world. In the last decade, Old Jaffa has become one of the hottest places to be as designers, artists and gourmands move in. Come hungry because street food is abundant and delicious.

### Tel Aviv Port (North Port - Namal)
Tel Aviv’s port is one of the city’s main entertainment hubs with trendy shops, bars, nightclubs, cafés and a bustling farmers’ market.

### Neve Tzedek and historic train station (Tachana)
Neve Tzedek is one of Tel Aviv’s most beautiful neighborhoods – and historically, was the first neighborhood built outside of Jaffa. It’s perfect for a romantic stroll along the small streets and alleyways and past the beautifully restored buildings.

### Bauhaus Architecture
Tel Aviv boasts a treasure trove of exemplary architecture. One of Tel Aviv’s nicknames is even the White City, thanks to its large number of white Bauhaus (International-style) buildings. In 2003, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) proclaimed Tel Aviv’s White City a World Cultural Heritage site.

### Culture Square
Tel Aviv is Israel’s culture city. Most of the museums, orchestras, theaters, art galleries, dance venues and music halls come with an entry fee, however. There are many great museums in Tel Aviv, including the Eretz Israel Museum, Tel Aviv Art Museum, Independence Hall, etc.
