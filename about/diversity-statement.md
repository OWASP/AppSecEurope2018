The crux of security is the ability to think flexibly and creatively about multi-stakeholder problems. It is the goal of OWASP to connect the community and enable serendipity, in order to accelerate the speed of change. In our view, security can only be enhanced when practitioners approach problems with diverse critical thinking theories and practices. To this end OWASP seeks to be an inclusive organization for practitioners from all cultural, gender, language, educational, ability, religious, and career backgrounds.  OWASP actively encourages speakers, trainers, and leaders of all sexual orientations, ages, and ethnicity.  Our formal efforts in this vein include blind evaluations of talk and training proposals for our Global AppSec Conferences and active recruiting of diverse invited speakers.

Ways you can help:

* Encourage the amazing speakers and trainers you know to apply
* Forward our call for papers to your local affinity groups and ensure that they know OWASP is an inclusive place to speak.
* Speak at your local affinity groupâ€™s meetings about the opportunities at OWASP and invite them to attend local meetings and events.
* Suggest ways that the onsite conference experience can be more welcoming and supportive. Send an email to: [AppSecEU2018@owasp.org](mailto:AppSecEU2018@owasp.org)
